Scripting and Automation - D411 Task 2 Code
This assignment was tedious and difficult for me but I ended up passing the class! This is the finished result and I couldn't be more proud. It might not be the best code but still, this was a learning experience.
If your having trouble then use this as a reference to complete the tasks. I especially had trouble outputting the data on a file to the active directory 'Finance' group and calling my SQL tables correctly in the second part as well.
Feel free to point out ways to improve the code and what do do better next time since that is the only way we will get better at this as a whole.
